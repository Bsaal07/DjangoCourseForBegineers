An **ISO year** is part of the **ISO 8601 standard** for representing dates and times. It is a year format used in the ISO week date system, which focuses on weeks rather than months. The ISO year may differ from the Gregorian calendar year in some cases.

### Key Features of the ISO Year:

1. **Starts with Week 1:**

   - An ISO year begins with **Week 1**, which is defined as the week containing the **first Thursday** of the year.
   - Alternatively, Week 1 is the week containing **January 4th**.
   - This ensures that each ISO year starts with a full week.

2. **ISO Week Format:**

   - Dates are expressed in the format: `YYYY-Www-D` (e.g., `2024-W05-3`), where:
     - `YYYY` is the ISO year.
     - `Www` is the week number (e.g., `W05` is Week 5).
     - `D` is the day of the week (1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday).

3. **Differences from Gregorian Calendar Year:**
   - The ISO year can start in the **previous calendar year** (late December) or extend into the **next calendar year** (early January).
   - For example:
     - **December 30, 2023** is part of **ISO year 2024**, as it falls in Week 1 of 2024.
     - **January 1, 2024** is part of the same ISO year 2024.
